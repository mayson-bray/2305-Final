## Description
My program will be a Reference Photo Manager that is designed to assist artists in organizing and managing a 
library of tagged reference photos. You will be able to upload photos and tag them with characteristics of 
your choosing and seach for said tags at any time.

## Features

	- Simple ui that will manage the programs interface. It will be a window with an interface allowing the 
    user to upload, search, and tag photos. 
- Feature 2
	- Upload feature that will be a button that takes you to a new window where you can select an image file 
    and then write a tag of what is in the photo i.e. metal or futuristic architecture.
- Feature 3
	- The seach button will take you to a new window where you can select from a drop down of the existing
    tags that have been created.
