## Discription 
This app is a text based tool that helps you manage reference photos for large projects. You can add photos based on file paths and the app will copy uploaded photos into a folder that is created based on tags you create. You can then search tags to find the file path of the folders you are looking for. 
For example, if you have 25 monkey photos, you will upload each one with the "monkey" tag and it will copy the photos into a monkey folder. later, you can then search the "monkey tag" and it will give you the location of the monkey folder.
